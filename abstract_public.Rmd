During this period, until present day, there have been and continues to be series of destructive events that have threatened the stability of financial systems due to OpRisk. In most, if not all of these cases, human error is at the center of the chain of events that lead or may lead to (OpRisk) losses. There are many attitudes that can potentially infect organisational processes, the  most persistent of these attitudes stem from human failings that are exploitable @barberis2003survey, thus forming a basis for the theoretical foundation of \texttt{OpRisk}.

@shefrin2016behavioral notes that people would rather incur greater risks to hold on to things they already have, than the risks they would taken to get into that position in the first place, thereby risking a banks' survival, rather than expose their trading losses by consciously deceiving senior management to hide unethical operational practices.
