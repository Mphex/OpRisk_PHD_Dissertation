# Introduction

As presented in the previous chapter, Marginal Mediation Analysis (MMA) has the ability to simplify the interpretation of mediated effects in a wide variety of situations, particularly in situations where an effect size otherwise does not exist (e.g., indirect effects when the mediator or outcome is categorical). In this chapter, methods fashioned to develop MMA and evaluate its performance are discussed via three phases:

1. Development of MMA
2. Monte Carlo Simulation Study of MMA
3. Application of MMA

\noindent These phases were designed to provide the theory and the software to perform MMA, assess the method's ability to accurately estimate the underlying effects, develop the guidelines of its use in finite samples, and apply it to real-world prevention data by replicating a recent study [@Ford2012] that used a categorical mediator and categorical outcomes. Below, each phase is described in depth.

# Phase I: Development of Marginal Mediation Analysis

To be useful to public health, psychological, and prevention researchers, the incorporation of average marginal effects within mediation analysis must happen in two ways: in theory and in software. This phase is focused on understanding the properties of MMA and on developing the software necessary to perform it.

## Properties of MMA

Building on the mediation framework discussed by @Hayes2009 and by Edwards and Lambert (2007), MMA was established on linear regression---either ordinary least squares (OLS) for continuous outcomes/mediators or maximum likelihood (via GLMs) for categorical outcomes/mediators. In this framework, two or more regression equations are combined to provide the overall mediation model as discussed in Chapter 1. This method then adds a post-estimation step (Chapter 2) into this mediation framework. 

The form of the general marginal mediation model, including the post-estimation step, were discussed in Chapter 3. Using this general framework, various considerations were made in the development of the method. First, an appropriate manner in which to integrate moderation (interaction effects) into the framework is important. Because of the work by Edwards and Lambert (2007), this included assessing the *reduced form*\footnote{Reduced form refers to only having exogenous variables on the right-hand side of a regression equation (i.e., substituting the predictors of the mediators into the equation).} of the models in addition to visualizations of the predicted values across levels of the moderator. Second, it has been noted by @mackinnon2008intro that in non-linear models the $a \times b + c'$ generally does not equal the $c$ path as it does in linear models (Chapter 11 in his book). To assess whether these are equal within MMA, both a basic analysis and a Monte Carlo simulation (phase II) was used.


## Software Development

A major aspect of this first phase is the development of the software for researchers to apply MMA. This software is provided via the R statistical environment given R is free, widely used by researchers in health and prevention, and extensions to the software via "packages" are efficiently disseminated through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). It consists of a number of functions to fit the model and assess the modelâ€™s fit while efficiently producing the paths and effects in proper units. 

Because of the flexibility of numerical derivation methods and the speed improvements by Thomas Leeper (2017), numerical derivatives were used to obtain the marginal effects for each observational unit. From here, means of the marginal effects were calculated for each variable in the model. To assess the model uncertainty, bootstrapping via the `boot` R package was applied. This approach relies on repeated resampling from the original sample *with replacement*. In general, this method does not rely on any distributional assumptions and works well with asymmetric distributions (as is found in indirect effects).

The package applies the best practices for both computational speed and user readability [@Wickham2015], allowing other researchers to extend the package more easily. Additionally, several built-in tests will inform the functionality of the package before beginning Phase 2. These tests were performed on Linux, Mac, and Windows platforms. Finally, the package uses Git as the version control system. The necessary functions were developed first so that the package tests and simulations could begin. The usability of the package that is important in the disseminated version were developed afterwards.

# Phase II: Monte Carlo Simulation Study of Marginal Mediation Analysis

The evaluation of MMA is an essential step in understanding its properties and robustness and further assess the performance of the software. The consistency of MMA, the statistical power at various sample sizes, and the accuracy of the bootstrapped confidence intervals were all tested via a Monte Carlo simulation study [@Paxton2001; @Carsey2013]. 

In the simulation, data were simulated to come from a population of known parameters. A literature review of mediation analysis in prevention work highlighted the appropriateness of the population parameters chosen. The results of the simulation helped in the development of the guidelines for using MMA in practice.

## Literature Review

Before performing the Monte Carlo simulations, a review of the literature is recommended [@Paxton2001]. This review focused on the use of mediation analysis in prevention research where the analyses contained categorical mediators and/or outcomes. This review included all recent articles (2008 - 2017) found that clearly identified a mediator or outcome that was categorical in nature. This search relied on terms such as "generalized linear models", "logistic", "dichotomous", "polytomous", and "count" in conjunction with "mediation analysis" across the Scopus database.

## Simulations

Monte Carlo simulations, via the R statistical environment version 3.4.2, assessed the finite properties of MMA. Monte Carlo simulation was selected due to its simplicity in generating informative results and its high success in the literature [e.g., @Graham2007; @Nylund2007]. Here, 500 data sets were simulated for each combination of experimental conditions [@Paxton2001; @Carsey2013]. The data were simulated from a known population with a researcher specified causal model (i.e., the "population model"). The model consisted of either a binary mediator (0 = "No", 1 = "Yes") or a count variable (Poisson distribution), a continuous outcome, and a continuous predictor while also varying the sample size and the effect sizes for a total of 90 unique combinations of the conditions (see Table \ref{tab_conditions}). 

The $a$ path population model is defined below for when the mediator is binary, where the $Prob(M_{u} = 1)$ is a latent continuous variable with a logistic relationship with the predictors and the $\epsilon_i$ is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
\begin{equation}
log(\frac{Prob(M_{u} = 1)_{i}}{1 - Prob(M_{u} = 1)_{i}}) = a_0 + a_1 x + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}
\noindent The observed variable, $M_{o}$, is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
M_{o} = \begin{cases}
            0, & \text{if } Prob(M_u = 1) < .5, \\
            1, & \text{otherwise}.
         \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The $a$ path population model for when the mediator is a count is shown below where $M_u$ is a latent continuous variable with an exponential relationship with the predictors and the $\epsilon_i$ is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
\begin{equation}
log(M_u) = a_0 + a_1 x + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}
\noindent The observed variable, $M_{o}$, is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
M_{o} = Po(\lambda = M_u)
\end{equation}
\noindent This creates an observed, count variable that has $\lambda$ values based on the latent mediator.

The $b$ and $c'$ paths population model is identical to Equation \ref{equation_b} with only one predictor and a single binary, or count, mediator, as shown below.
\begin{equation}
M_{i} = a_0 + a_1 x_1 + \epsilon_{mi}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Y_{i} = \beta_0 + b M_{i} + c^{'} x_{i} + \epsilon_{yi}
\end{equation}

Table \ref{tab_conditions} highlights the conditions that were varied for each simulation. A distinct MMA model was applied to each of the 500 data sets for each possible combination of experimental conditions. This means 45,000 MMA models were fit. Using eight cores of powerful core i7 computers, these computations were finished over a span of several days.

Notably, the effect sizes for both the binary mediator and count mediator (a path) were the odds ratios and risk ratios corresponding to small, moderate, and large effect sizes. These are found in Table \ref{effectsizes}.

Large    & 6.73 & 3.01 & 0.50 \\ 
%\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The focus of the simulations was to gauge the accuracy, power, and coverage of MMA at estimating the population effects while undergoing the experimental conditions. The dependent variables were: 

1. bias (i.e., is the mean of the estimates at the population mean?), 
2. power (i.e., how often does the null properly get rejected?), 
3. confidence interval coverage (i.e., does the confidence interval cover the proper interval?), and 
4. consistency regarding how closely $a \times b + c'$ is to $c$ (i.e., does the indirect plus the direct effect equal the total effect?). 

\noindent The effects of the conditions on these outcomes were assessed via visualizations and descriptive tables.

## Guideline Development

Recommendations from the simulation study were documented, including necessary sample sizes, bias in various conditions, and the accuracy of bootstrapped confidence intervals in each condition. The documentation will be available in manual form online on the [R website](http://www.r-project.org) and [GitHub](github.com).


# Phase III: Application of Marginal Mediation Analysis

During the third phase, all important aspects of MMA discovered throughout the first two phases were used to replicate previous work regarding the relationship of adolescent religiosity with substance use (Figure \ref{fig:theorymed}). This study was selected given it used:

1. a large sample with a mix of binary and continuous mediators and outcomes,
2. one of the better and common statistical approaches, and
3. data that were publicly available and that had a more recent release to investigate.

\end{figure}

## Data

<!-- http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/23782 -->

To replicate this study, data from the 2014 (most recent) release of National Survey on Drug Use and Health [NSDUH; @Ford2012] were used. As described by @Ford2012, the NSDUH is "an ongoing study sponsored by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration that dates back to the 1970s" (page 4) and collects data on drug use of individuals 12 years and older across the United States. Ford's study used the 2007 data release while the replication uses the 2014. Several measures\footnote{Notably, this replication study omits the "heavy drinking" outcome because positive responses to it were very rare in the 2014 data.} were used to replicate the findings of @Ford2012:

1. Four substance use outcomes (tobacco use, prescription drug use, marijuana use, and illicit drug use).
2. Religiosity was based on the average response across four items relating to church attendance, the importance of religious beliefs to the individual, and participation in faith-based activities. Higher scores indicated more religiosity.
3. Respondent attitudes toward substance use was also the average response based on four items gauging the individual's response to someone their age using substances. Higher scores indicate more conservative attitudes.
4. Peer attitudes toward substance use is similar to the respondent attitudes except that it was asked how the individual's friends would feel about someone their age using substances. Again, the average response was used where higher scores indicate more conservative attitudes.
5. "Psychological well-being was indicated by major depression," (page 5) which was measured as at least five of the nine possible depression symptoms listed in the survey. 

### Substance Use

As stated previously, the substance use outcomes are tobacco use, prescription drug use, marijuana use, and illicit drug use. 

- Tobacco use was defined as one of the following three items: 1) cigarette use within the last year, 2) smokeless tobacco use within the last year, and 3) cigar use within the last year.
- Prescription drug use consisted of four groups of drugs that are being used either without a prescription or for the sole purpose of obtaining a high within the last year: pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives.
- Marijuana use was a single item: marijuana use within the last year.
- Illicit drug use was defined as using any of the following drugs within the last year: cocaine, crack, heroin, hallucinogens, LSD, PCP, ecstasy, inhalants, or meth.

\noindent Each outcome was coded as dichotomous: use or no use within the last year.


### Religiosity

Adolescent religiosity was the mean response across four items: 1) the number of times attended religious activities in past year, 2) religious beliefs are important, 3) religious beliefs influence decisions, and 4) the amount of participation in religious activities. The higher the average score the more the adolescent is considered to be religious.


### Respondent and Peer Attitudes

The respondent's conservative views on drug use is the average of four items, answering the question "How do you feel about someone your age using [cigarettes daily, marijuana, marijuana monthly, drinking daily]?" Similarly, the peer's conservative views on drug use is the average of four items, answering the question "How do you think your close friends would feel about you using [cigarettes daily, marijuana, marijuana monthly, drinking daily]?"


### Psychological Well-being

Finally, psychological well-being was defined as having had a major depressive episode in the past year. This was a binary (yes or no) variable based on "if they reported experiencing at least five of the following: felt sad, empty, or depressed most of the day or discouraged; lost interest or pleasure in most things; experienced changes in appetite or weight; sleep problems; other noticed you were restless or lethargic; felt tired or low energy nearly every day; felt worthless nearly every day; inability to concentrate or make decisions; any thoughts or plans of suicide," [@Ford2012, pg. 5]. 


## Analyses

The mediation analyses were replicated from @Ford2012. Although the mediation analysis is performed differently herein, the model specifications were identical to that employed there.

Importantly, @Ford2012 say: "we use the categorical data method outlined by MacKinnon (2008) to formally test the indirect effects," (pg. 5). This approach uses a significance test based on the estimates of both $a$ and $b$ and their standard errors. However, as stated throughout this project, the significance alone is insufficient information to provide for a mediation analysis; effect sizes are also necessary. Because of this, @Ford2012 continue by discussing the amount of the association between the predictor and outcome, in percentage units, that the mediator accounted for. This approach is useful but has some notable shortcomings. First, depending on the level of multi-collinearity in the models, the standard errors of the estimates can be inefficient which reduces the statistical power of this test. Second, it does not provide the effect size measures that would be most useful (e.g., the effect a one unit increase in the predictor has on the outcome through the mediator). Third, the measure is consistently too conservative with binary outcomes [@Jiang2015].

For the replication, then, each of the mediation models reported were run using MMA in place of the techniques employed by @Ford2012. Four distinct MMA models, one for each of the substance use outcomes, were assessed. These were all controlling for (adjusting for) parental attitudes towards substance use, age, race, sex, and income. The models included 500 bootstrapped samples to obtain 95\% confidence intervals. 

Further, using a variant of the "difference method," the amount of the total effect that was mediated was calculated using the following:
$$
\text{Proportion mediated} =\frac{indirect}{indirect + direct}
$$ 
\noindent Finally, the information provided through the use of MMA was also compared to that produced in the original paper.\footnote{All analysis code is available on the Open Science Framework (osf.io/753kc) and in the Appendices of this document.}

# Conclusions

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to develop, evaluate and apply a method that can provide meaningful interpretation in mediation when the mediator and/or outcome is categorical. Each phase builds on this goal, as is discussed in the following chapters starting with the presentation of the results of Phase I and Phase II regarding the theory, software, and evaluation of MMA.
